# Music Store Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing data from a music store database using SQL queries. The database contains information about customers, employees, sales transactions, and music inventory.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the music store database using SQL queries. This README provides an overview of the database schema, the queries used for analysis, and instructions for setting up the project environment.

## Database Schema

The database schema includes the following tables:

- **Customers**: Contains information about store customers.
- **Employees**: Stores details of employees working at the music store.
- **Tracks**: Information about each music track available for purchase.
- **Albums**: Details of music albums which include multiple tracks.
- **Invoices**: Records of sales transactions made by customers.
- **Invoice_Items**: Lists individual items (tracks or albums) purchased in each invoice.

## Queries

The SQL queries used in this project cover various aspects of data analysis:

1. **Basic Queries**:
   - Retrieve customer details (names, emails, etc.).
   - List all employees and their positions.
   - Count the number of tracks and albums in the store.

2. **Sales Analysis**:
   - Calculate total revenue generated.
   - Determine the top-selling tracks and albums.
   - Analyze sales trends over time (monthly, quarterly).

3. **Customer Insights**:
   - Identify the highest spending customers.
   - Segment customers based on purchase behavior.

4. **Inventory Management**:
   - List tracks that need restocking based on sales.
   - Identify albums with the highest and lowest sales.

5. **Employee Performance**:
   - Evaluate sales performance of each employee.
   - Compare sales performance across different time periods.

## Setup Instructions

To run the queries and analyze the data, follow these steps:

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure you have access to the music store database.
   - Use SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench, or any SQL client to connect to the database.

2. **Running Queries**:
   - Open the SQL file containing the queries.
   - Execute each query to retrieve results.

3. **Interpreting Results**:
   - Review the output of each query to derive insights.
   - Use visualization tools like Excel or Python libraries for further analysis if needed.

## Additional Notes

- This project is designed to showcase SQL skills in data analysis.
- Feel free to modify or expand upon the queries provided to explore different aspects of the database.
